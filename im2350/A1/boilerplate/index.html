        <u><h2>Week 2</h2></u>

        <ol>


            <li><h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3></li> 
            
            <p>The first caption that caught my eye was the ‘Send Me A Letter?’ feature. An image of an envelope compliments the text. Everything else on the homepage seemed disorganised. This was the only part of the page where the image and text had relevance to each other.</p>


            <br>


            <li><h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3></li>
            
            <ul>

            <li><p>I looked at the entire page to see what should be clicked.</p></li>

            <li><p>I clicked the ‘‘Send Me A Letter?’ button.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I looked at the entire page to see what should be clicked.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I clicked the ‘Send Me A Letter?’ button.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I wrote down a short text.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I listened to the accompanying typing audio.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I clicked next to the ‘From:’ button and typed my name.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I clicked the ‘Send’ button.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I watched the letters turn into sand and drop to the bottom.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I clicked the Pencil icon and clicked and dragged my mouse across the screen. This resulted in temporary scribbles that fell and accumulated at the bottom as sand.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I clicked the ‘A’ icon and typed on multiple areas of the screen.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I clicked the ‘Send’ button and watched the letters turn into sand.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I immediately clicked the Eraser button and erased the sand while it was falling down.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I clicked the Undo button and watched each action I have done previously get undone.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I clicked the back button to return to the homepage.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I watched the random GIF placed on the left, trying to understand what it signified.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I randomly clicked links starting from the bottom.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I briefly scrolled through the content for each page.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I clicked the Sandspiel link towards the end of the two minutes.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I watched the game start with falling sand and growing flowers.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I clicked and dragged across the screen to water the flowers.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I watched the flowers grow taller after coming in contact with the water.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I looked at the options on the left and clicked ‘Stone’.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I clicked and held my mouse to pile the stone on one point.</p></li>

            <li><h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3></li> 
            
            <p>I spent the most time playing the Sandspiel game. I found it captivating to be able to build or destroy your mini garden by dropping the pixelated sand. The resulting shapes and forms were very fascinating. My favourite function was ‘Stone’. I liked how the end result was skyscraper towers crawling with plants. It almost resembles what I would imagine worlds in Sci Fi and Solarpunk novels to be like.</p>

            
            <br>


            <div class="sandspiel"><img src="img/sandspiel.png" height="780" width="2080"/></div>


            <br>


            <li><h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3></li> 
            
            <p>‘Clicking’ was most common. It did not vary by much either. It was direct clicking, click and drag or click and hold.</p>


            <br>


            <li><h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3></li> 
            
            <p>I found both games to be fun. Each had their own selling point such as posing as a typewriter or world building, yet they still could be tied in together. However, the webpage was not successful in immediately convincing me which links were the main interactive experiences on the page due to its poor choice of layout.</p>


            <br>


            <li><h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3></li> 
            
            <p>I was underwhelmed at how awful the website was at directing its users to its intended interactive experiences. Finding the sand art experience in the ‘Send Me A Letter?’ was more straightforward than the Sandspiel. The image of a letter caught my attention on a page that was mostly filled with text or irrelevant images. It was however harder to realise that there was a secondary game called Sandspiel on the page because there was no indication to users that there is something interesting behind the link.</p>


            <br>


            <li><h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3></li> 
            
            <p>In general, I can interact with it for 5 mins to fully explore the page. I think that it can be explored twice. The only deviation being how the user chooses to play Sandspiel. To fully enjoy the game and feel a sense of satisfaction, I would play it to only create or only destroy. That way I can see the full extent of what can be made from the allocated tools and how the destructive tools interact to dissolve matter.</p>

           
            <br>


            <li><h3>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3></li> 
            
            <p>It is not something most would return to. There isn’t enough content or updated content to require an excess amount of time to explore. The layout is not varied or interesting either. Visually it does not fall in line with what the website is trying to present. Thus making it uninteresting. For eg, the font could have resembled more of handwriting font to suit the letter template. If falling sand art drawings are the highlight of the website, it could have been more clear to the audience. This can be by having a more obvious accessible button.</p>


        </ol>

        <u><h2>Week 3</h2></u>

        <ol>


            <li><h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3></li> 
            
            <p>The first caption that caught my eye was the ‘Send Me A Letter?’ feature. An image of an envelope compliments the text.</p>

            <p>It references world building video games. It would be a stretch to say that it is like Minecraft. However, I do see a few similarities in that raw materials and used to construct spaces.</p>

            <br>


            <li><h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3></li> 


            <br>

            
            <p>Since it is referenced off video games, it means that the information and tools would have to be ‘earned’ and will not be immediately presented in front of me. Therefore, I should actively explore the page with a curious mind. By doing so, I can discover and play around the games and tools scattered across the page.</p>

            
            <br>


            <li><h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3></li> 
            
            <p>Navigating the page could take more time and the hints may be subtle. Thus, I should be patient in exploring the page to find whatever ‘hidden gems’ the creator leaves for users to find.</p>

            
            <br>


            <li><h3>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3></li> 
            
            <p>The most frustrating thing about the website is its layout. Not only is the choice of font and colours boring, it looked disorganised and clustered. This made it hard for me to pinpoint the highlights of the page.</p>
            
            
            <br>


            <li><h3>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3></li> 
  
            <p>The most satisfying part is writing a letter using the ‘Send Me A Letter?’ feature. It falls in line with my personal interest in letter writing and thus piqued by curiosity. The sound of a functioning typewriter further elevates the charming experience. By imitating a typewriter from its audio to visual delay, I was linked to a sense of familiarity.</p>
